# CppSim: Open Source System-Level Design Tool for RF/Mixed-Signal Circuits 
Many thanks to Dr. Michael H. Perrott. CppSim has been widely used a variety of research and industrial projects in global semiconductor industry. The CppSim website (https://cppsim.com) provides tons of lectures/tutorials of circuit design for electrical engineers. 
I plan to start this project to make some contributions to this excellent open source tool.
